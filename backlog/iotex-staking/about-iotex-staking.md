# About IoTeX Staking

## What is Staking

A core component of decentralized governance in the IoTeX Network is staking. In this process, token holders deposit (or "stake") IOTX to support network operations, consensus, and governance. By staking, these holders not only enhance the security of the IoTeX Network but also earn IOTX rewards in return.

## Delegates and Consensus

IoTeX utilizes a consensus mechanism known as [Roll-DPoS](https://res.cloudinary.com/dokc3pa1x/image/upload/v1559623484/Research%20Paper/Academic\_Paper\_Yellow\_Paper.pdf). In this system, community-voted Delegates manage consensus on behalf of the IoTeX Network. Anyone can “stake” their IOTX and cast a "vote" for one or more Delegates. A comprehensive list of IoTeX Delegates is available on the [Staking Portal](http://member.iotex.io/). Here, youu can also stake your tokens, choose delegates to support, and manage your ongoing staking deposits.
