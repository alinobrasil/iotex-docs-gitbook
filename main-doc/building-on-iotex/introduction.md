# Introduction

## Purpose and benefits of building on IoTeX

IoTeX represents an advanced ecosystem of blockchain technologies and tools, designed to facilitate the development of a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps) that perform faste, with a 5-second confirmation, 1-block confirmations, and reliably. IoTeX provides an Ethereum compatible environment thus it supports dApps including DeFi, gaming, NFT collectibles, as well as industrial applications.

In fact, IoTeX integrates a cutting-edge Zero Knowledge (ZK) -based data processing scaling infrastructure, called **W3bstream**. This solution is critical in scaling dApps when their token economy depends on extensive volumes of real-world data. This integration not only enhances efficiency but also expands the potential of blockchain applications in integrating with our every-day life.&#x20;

#### The IoTeX Blockchain

The IoTeX blockchain offers an environment similar to Ethereum for developers, but with distinct advantages tailored to enhance both developer and user experiences.

1. **Familiarity**: Building on IoTeX is like building on Ethereum. Developers familiar to Ethereum's environment will find the transition seamless, reducing the learning curve.
2. **Speed**: Your dApps on IoTeX operate with impressive speed. With transaction confirmations in just 5 seconds and 1-block finality, ensuring your users don't face the common lag or delays seen on other blockchains, significantly elevating user experience.
3. **Cost-Effective**: One of IoTeX's standout features is its affordability. Running DApps or executing transactions incurs minimal fees, which translates to cost savings for both developers and end-users.
4. **Scalability**: IoTeX is designed for growth. It can efficiently handle an influx of transactions, making it future-proof and ideal for DApps expecting high volume or rapid expansion.
5. **Diverse Application**: The versatility of IoTeX's platform is evident in the range of DApps it supports. Whether it's Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Gaming, Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collectibles, or other emerging categories like decentralized social networks and supply chain management, IoTeX is equipped to handle them all.

By choosing to deploy dApps on IoTeX, developers are not only tapping into a platform that mirrors the best of Ethereum but also advancing into an ecosystem optimized for the next generation of digital applications.

#### W3bstream: Verifiable computation for DePIN applications

Transitioning from the advantages of the IoTeX blockchain, let's delve into the dynamics of W3bstream—a groundbreaking verifiable compute infrastructure specifically tailored for DePIN projects. W3bstream plays a pivotal role in bridging smart devices with the decentralized ecosystem by offering:

* **Universal Connectivity**: Thanks to its familiar API tailored for devices, W3bstream accommodates both HTTPS and MQTT, streamlining data transfer processes from a multitude of devices.
* **Versatile Storage Solutions**: W3bstream's modular architecture ensures that DePIN apps can securely store device data. It integrates effortlessly with both centralized and decentralized storage platforms, offering developers an array of choices based on their application needs.
* **Computational Integrity**: Each W3bstream node boasts a WASM VM. This empowers the infrastructure to process intricate machine data, subsequently generating verifiable proofs of the computational outcomes—ready to be dispatched to blockchain-based applications.
* **Seamless Blockchain Interaction**: W3bstream doesn't just streamline data processing—it actively enhances blockchain interactivity. Developers can effortlessly index smart contracts, react to on-chain events, and interact with a plethora of smart contracts across both EVM and non-EVM chains.

Incorporating W3bstream into your DePIN project doesn't merely provide a seamless data flow from devices to decentralized applications. It ensures that every piece of data, every transaction, and every interaction retains the highest standard of verifiability and integrity. By harnessing the combined prowess of the IoTeX blockchain and W3bstream, developers are poised to redefine the landscape of decentralized physical infrastructure networks.
