# Metamask & Wallets

## Overview

A blockchain wallet, sometimes just called a 'crypto wallet,' is a digital tool that allows individuals to store, send, and receive digital currencies like IoTeX, Ethereum, and many others. If you're just getting started with blockchain, think of it like an online banking app, but instead of using it for traditional money, you use it for cryptocurrencies.

Just like learning to use a new app or device, it might take a little time to get used to how a blockchain wallet works, but it's an essential tool for anyone looking to engage with cryptocurrencies.

#### **Public and Private Keys**

A blockchain wallet has two key components ‚Äì a public key and a private key. The public key is like your account number or email address; it's what you share with others so they can send you cryptocurrency. The private key is like your password or PIN; it's what you use to access and send your funds. You must keep your private key secure because anyone with access to it can control your funds.

#### **Wallet Addresses**

Much like bank account numbers, blockchain wallets use unique strings of letters and numbers called wallet addresses. These addresses are derived from your wallet's public key to make it shorter, and easier to read. You share your wallet address with others when you want to receive funds, providing a convenient and way to facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrencies.

#### **Security**

Wallets are secured through various means such as passwords, biometric authentication, and sometimes even multi-factor authentication, which might include codes sent to your phone or email.

#### **Types of Wallets**

**Software Wallets:** These are apps or programs you can download to your phone or computer. They can be custodial (a third party holds your private keys) or non-custodial (you're in control of your private keys).

**Hardware Wallets:** These are physical devices that look a bit like USB drives and are considered more secure because they store your private keys inside their hardware. While the private keys remain inaccessible to others, you as the owner can use the device to authorize transfers securely.

**Paper Wallets:** Essentially just a piece of paper with your public and private keys printed on it, paper wallets are immune to digital theft but easily lost, damaged, or physically stolen. They've largely been replaced by more secure and convenient forms of crypto storage.

**Interacting with Blockchains:** When you want to send or receive cryptocurrencies, you do so through transactions that are recorded on the blockchain. If you're sending, you'll need the recipient's wallet address and access to your private key to sign off on the transaction.

#### **Wallet Software Functionality**

Most blockchain wallets also show your balance, transaction history, and provide an interface to interact with different blockchains. Some wallets support multiple types of cryptocurrencies and multiple blockchains, while others are designed for a single blockchain.

#### **Decentralization**

Unlike traditional banks, blockchain wallets are decentralized. This means that no central authority controls your funds. Instead, you have complete ownership and responsibility for your digital assets.

#### **Network Fees**

Transactions often require a fee that goes to the miners or validators who process and secure the blockchain network. Wallets help you manage these fees by allowing you to set how much you‚Äôre willing to pay for a transaction, which can affect how quickly it gets processed.

#### Why Use a Blockchain Wallet?

**Sovereignty:** You have full control over your digital assets without the need for a traditional bank.

**Portability:** You can access your assets from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection.

**Security:** Advanced encryption techniques secure your funds, making them hard to steal when proper security practices are followed.

**Transparency:** The use of public keys allows for transparency since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain and are viewable by anyone.

#### Important Tips for New Users:

**Backups:** Always back up your wallet, especially your private keys. If you lose your private key and don‚Äôt have a backup, you lose access to your funds.

**Security:** Be wary of phishing attacks and scam websites/apps. Only download wallets from trusted sources.

**Understanding:** Ensure you understand the basics of the wallet's operation before transferring large amounts of cryptocurrency to or from it. Remember, it's wise to test with a small amount first.

## Metamask

### Intro to Metamask

MetaMask is a popular crypto wallet widely used on desktop computers as a browser plugin. Initially designed for the Ethereum blockchain, MetaMask compatibility with other blockchain ecosystems, including IoTeX, make is exceptionally versatile. By configuring the wallet's settings, you can connect to the IoTeX network, enabling you to manage, send, and receive IOTX and ERC-20 tokens and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on the IoTeX Blockchain directly from your web browser.

</details>

Connecting **Metamask** to the **IoTeX blockchain** is as easy as adding a new network in Metamask, and configuring it using the IoTeX testnet or mainnet RPC endpoints.&#x20;

### Connect Metamask to the IoTeX Network

After MetaMask is installed in your browser, it comes pre-configured to connect to the Ethereum blockchain. However, you can easily add configurations for additional blockchains to use it across multiple networks, including IoTeX. You can do this either by entering the blockchain network configuration details manually or by using the links provided on the IoTeX Developer Portal.
