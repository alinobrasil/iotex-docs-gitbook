# Swapping IOTX Tokens

## **Swapping IOTX on Ethereum for Native IOTX Tokens**

If you intend to stake your IOTX tokens, or interact with dApps on the IoTeX blockchain, you won't be able to do so with the IOTX tokens held on the Ethereum blockchain. In this scenario, you'll need to swap your IOTX on Ethereum with IOTX on the IoTeX blockchain, which is the native network of the IOTX token and supports staking.

This can be done using the official iotube.org dApp.

## **Steps to Swap**

{% hint style="info" %}
To swap your IOTX you will have to interact with both uniswap and iotube.org dApps. Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover for these contracts gas fees. You can get a rough estimation of current Ethereum gas fees on [https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)
{% endhint %}

* If you are using Metamask, then open the following dApps in your Metamask browser
* If you are using ioPay mobile, then open the dApps from the ioPay in-app Browser

### Step 1: Swap IOTX for CIOTX on Uniswap

{% hint style="info" %}
This step happens on the Ethereum blockchain and is subject to the Ethereum network fee.
{% endhint %}

1. Visit Uniswap and select `IOTX` as the source token and `CIOTX` (_"Crosschain IOTX"_) as the output token: use the following link to make sure the correct tokens are already selected [Open Uniswap ->](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x6fB3e0A217407EFFf7Ca062D46c26E5d60a14d69\&outputCurrency=0x9F90B457Dea25eF802E38D470ddA7343691D8FE1)
2. Select the amount of `IOTX` you want to swap, or click "_max_" if you want to swap the entire `IOTX` balance
3. Confirm the swap and wait for your `CIOTX` balance in Uniswap to reflect it&#x20;

### Step 2: Swap CIOTX for CIOTX on the IoTeX Network

{% hint style="info" %}
This step happens on the Ethereum blockchain and is subject to the Ethereum network fee.
{% endhint %}

1. Visit iotube.org and connect your wallet
2. Select ETH as the source Network and IoTeX as the destination network
3. Input the amount of `CIOTX` on Ethereum that you want to swap with `CIOTX` on IoTeX (or click "_max_" if you want to swap the entire balance)
4. &#x20;Paste the recipient address where you want to receive the CIOTX tokens on the IoTeX blockchain (or click "My Wallet" if you want to use the same address that you use on Ethereum)&#x20;
5. Click the "Deposit" button to deposit the `CIOTX` tokens start the swap process:&#x20;

The swap process depends on the congestion of the Ethereum network, and it should take 5-10 minutes since when your deposit transaction is confirmed on Ethereum. You can monitor the status of your swap on the iotube explorer:

### Step 3: Swap CIOTX for Native IOTX

{% hint style="info" %}
This step happens on the IoTeX blockchain and is subject to the IoTeX network fee.
{% endhint %}

At this point, you should have received `CIOTX` tokens on the IoTeX blockchain.&#x20;

1. Check your CIOTX balance on IoTeX:
   1. Set your wallet on the IoTeX blockchain ([see how ->](../metamask/#switching-between-networks))
   2. Add the `CIOTX` token to your tokens list ([see how ->](../metamask/sending-transactions/manage-erc20-tokens.md))
2. Check that you have some `IOTX` balance to cover for gas fees. If your recipient address on IoTeX was empty, you may have received 0.1 `IOTX` airdrop from iotube:  ([ask in our community if you don't ->](https://t.me/iotexgroup))
3. Visit the Crosschain IOTX page on iotube
4. Finally, visit the mimo exchange and select `WIOTX` as the source token and `IOTX` as the destination one ([use this link for preconfigured options](https://swap.mimo.exchange/swap?inputCurrency=0xa00744882684c3e4747faefd68d283ea44099d03\&outputCurrency=IOTX) ->)
5. Confirm the swap.
