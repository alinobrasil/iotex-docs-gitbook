# Flashing the firmware

You will be required to flash a new firmware to your Pebble device in one of the following cases:

* Update the application Firmware \(e.g. for bug fixes or new added features to the main software\)
* Update the modem firmware \(e.g. to switch between NB-IoT and LTE-M cellular band support - Pebble comes preconfigured for NB-IoT\)
* Update the bootloader firmware \(e.g. for bug fixes or new low-level features\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please notice that when you flash the **modem** firmware, after the modem is updated you will have to **flash the application firmware again**.
