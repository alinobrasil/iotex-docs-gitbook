# Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable claims are statements made by an entity about a 'subject' whose authorship can be cryptographically verified. They can be combined with DID documents to provide trusted service. IoTeX verifiable credentials include the following features:

* Claims are used to create **verifiable credentials** by issuers.
* Verifiable credentials are **decentralized** and **contextual**.
* Credential issuers decide on which claims are contained in the credentials.
* Verifiers **make their own trust decisions** about which credentials to accept.
* Verifiers do not need to contact issuers to perform verification.
* Credential holders are free to choose which credentials to carry and what information to disclose.

Here is a draft IoTeX verifiable credentials example:
