Web3-oriented IoT devices refer to smart devices that are newly designed or repurposed from legacy ones with decentralized applications in mind.&#x20;

A Web3-oriented IoT device has the following characteristics:

* The device is often equipped with a piece of secure hardware for protecting cryptographic keys and executing cryptographic operations;
* The device contains a screen for showing a blockchain wallet address and other relevant information and buttons for selection and confirmation;
* The device supports over-the-air firmware updates for changing the device behavior or configurations;
* A private/public key pair is generated within the device during the manufacturing process and a DID might be derived as well;
* The device manufacturer needs to pre-register all its devices on the blockchain before shipping them to customers.

Web3-oriented IoT devices are able to connect with W3bstream nodes via the direct mode. Moreover, the device binding can be conducted using the decentralized, challenge-response-based approach. In particular, the Web3-oriented IoT devices can be easily differentiated from software simulators, thereby providing a strong guarantee regarding the data's trustworthiness.
