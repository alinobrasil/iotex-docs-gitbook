# Chain Indexing

Chain indexing plays a pivotal role in the Web3 space, primarily due to its impact on efficient data retrieval, improved performance, and enhanced user experiences. As blockchains grow in size and complexity, indexing becomes essential for organizing unstructured, distributed data into a more accessible format. This not only facilitates quicker and more efficient data queries for decentralized applications (dApps), but also supports complex data analysis and financial tracking. Additionally, chain indexing is vital for maintaining scalability and interoperability within the Web3 ecosystem.&#x20;

There are two ways of using indexing in your IoTeX dApp: IoTeX Analytics and SubQuery.&#x20;
