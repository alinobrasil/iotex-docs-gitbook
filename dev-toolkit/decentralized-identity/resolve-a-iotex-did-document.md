# Resolve a IoTeX DID Document



IoTeX DID document is a JSON-LD document containing six, optional components:

* The DID that points to the DID Document, identified by the key **id**
* A list of public keys identified by the key **publickey**
* List of protocols for authentication control of the DID and delegated capabilities identified by the key **authentication**
* A set of service endpoints that allow discovery of way to interact with the entity, identified by the key **service**
* A timestamp indicates when the DID Document was created and updated, identified by the key **created/updated**
* A digital signature for verifying the integrity of DID Document, identified by the key **proof**

{% hint style="success" %}
IoTeX DID has been integrated by [uniresolver.io (opens new window)](http://uniresolver.io/)which is the industrial de facto that resolves DID to the corresponding document
{% endhint %}

Here is a draft IoTeX DID document example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
