# Developer Portal

At its core, the portal is a place for developers to learn how to build DePIN **dApps** while contributing to the community and growing within it.

Developers will be able to find step-by-step, [hands-on tutorials](https://developers.iotex.io/academy/all), technical [blog articles](https://developers.iotex.io/blog/all) and updates and in-depth guides to learn about this new methodology and build the applications that will define the future of web3 and the machine economy.

Feel free to [get started](https://developers.iotex.io/) building your next dApp on real world data.&#x20;
