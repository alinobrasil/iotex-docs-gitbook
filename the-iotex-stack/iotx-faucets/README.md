# Get IOTX Tokens

## When do I need Mainnet Tokens?

Mainnet **IOTX** is the native IoTeX blockchain token that is mined on mainnet by IoTeX Consensus Delegates. This is the token that you find on both centralized or decentralized exchanges which holds a real monetary value.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The **IOTX** token is used to pay fees in the IoTeX blockchain.&#x20;

This means that you must have some IOTX in your IoTeX wallet if you want to perform any action with your assets.&#x20;
