# Make it cross-chain

To make your token cross-chain to IoTeX network, you can use bridges between IoTeX and other blockchains. There are two options now [ioTube](https://iotube.org/) and [anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router).&#x20;

## iotube

[iotube](https://iotube.org) is a cross-chain bridge designed to be decentralized, multi-chain, and multi-asset, to seamlessly connect IoTeX to popular blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and more.&#x20;

If you deployed a Dapp on any of the supported blockchains, you can **extend** your Dapp to IoTeX and the other supported chains supported by iotube by submitting your token for the addition to iotube.

**Submit** **your token for free** here:

## Anyswap

Anyswap is a fully decentralized cross-chain swap protocol, which enables any blockchain that uses ECDSA or EdDSA as a signature algorithm access to cross-chain bridge solutions. Anyswap has deployed cross-chain bridges for more than 600 projects and has developed 19 chains since itsâ€™ launch on the 20th of July 2020. Anyswap has launched its Multichain Router V3 beta mainnet more than one month ago, this multichain router has three significant features: Non-custodial+MPC, Native Swap, and Multichain Router (This feature allows users to swap between two chains arbitrarily, which reduces fees and makes it easier to move between chains.&#x20;
