# Make it cross-chain

To make your token cross-chain to IoTeX network, you can use bridges between IoTeX and other blockchains.

## iotube

[iotube](https://iotube.org) is a cross-chain bridge designed to be decentralized, multi-chain, and multi-asset, to seamlessly connect IoTeX to popular blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and more.&#x20;

If you deployed a Dapp on any of the supported blockchains, you can **extend** your Dapp to IoTeX and the other supported chains supported by iotube by submitting your token for the addition to iotube.

**Submit** **your token for free** here:
