# Arduino IDE

## Installing the library

In Arduino IDE, go to `Tools`->`Manage libraries...`

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (83) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In the Library Manager dialog, search for `IoTeX-blockchain-client` and click `install`&#x20;

## Dependencies

Using the Arduino IDE built-in Library Manager, also install the following libraries:

* [WiFiNINA](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFiNINA) : used for WiFi functionality in Nano 33 IoT
* [FlashStorage](https://github.com/cmaglie/FlashStorage) : used for EEPROM storage emulation in Nano 33 IoT

## Including the library in your sketch

Go to Sketch->Include library and select IoTeX-blockchain-client.

Alternatively, paste the following code `at the` beginning of your sketch:

`#include "IoTeX-blockchain-client.h"`

## Using the library in your sketches

Create the `Connection` object, passing the connection details:

```cpp
const char ip[] = "gateway.iotexlab.io";
const char baseUrl[] = "iotexapi.APIService";
const int port = 10000;

Connection<Api> connection(ip, port, baseUrl);
```

Now you are ready to call any of the API methods.

You can find examples of most of the API methods under the [examples](https://github.com/iotexproject/arduino-sdk/tree/main/examples) directory.

## Debug logs

Debug log level is set to NONE by default. The log level can be changed at runtime or at compile time.

Logs are printed to the `Serial` serial port by default. You need to initialize the serial port in your sketch by calling `Serial.begin(<baud rate>).`

The log level can be set per module, and also globally. A log statement is printed if it's level is higher than the log level configured for it's module, and higher than the global log level.

### Setting debug log level at run time

The log level can be set at run time using the `IotexHelpers` global object:

#### Setting per module log level

You can set the log level for a specific module. The existent log modules are:

* "GENERAL"
* "HTTP"
* "CONTRACT"

Simply call the following method on the `IotexHelpers` global object:\
`void setModuleLogLevel(const std::string& module, IotexLogLevel level)`

Eg. This will set the HTTP log level to `DEBUG`:\
`IotexHelpers.setModuleLogLevel("HTTP", IotexLogLevel::DEBUG);`

#### Setting the log level globally

You can also set the log level globally for all modules.

Simply call the following method on the `IotexHelpers` global object:\
`void setGlobalLogLevel(IotexLogLevel level)`

Eg. This will set the log level globally to `DEBUG`:\
`IotexHelpers.setGlobalLogLevel(IotexLogLevel::DEBUG);`
