# Wallets

A blockchain wallet application is a tool to safely encrypt and store private keys, sign actions and broadcast them to the blockchain.

[**ioPay** ](https://iopay.iotex.io/)is the official native wallet built by the IoTeX team that supports token transfers, contract calls, and staking.

**Web3** wallets like Metamask can also be used with IoTeX to execute token transfers and contract calls, but these wallets do not support staking.

In the following sections, you will learn how to configure both native IoTeX wallets and web3 wallets.
