# Off-chain Price-feeds

Off-chain price feeds play a crucial role in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications by providing accurate, real-time market data that is not stored on the blockchain itself.&#x20;

For developers, this means access to a broader range of data sources, ensuring more accurate and reliable price information. This is especially important for applications like lending platforms or decentralized exchanges, where precise asset valuation is essential for maintaining fairness and preventing manipulation or inaccuracies due to limited on-chain data.

Off-chain price feeds can be currently obtained through a [Chainlink Relayer](chainlink-relayer.md), or through [SupraOracles](supraoracles.md).
