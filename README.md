# üëã Welcome to IoTeX

IoTeX stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, offering a robust and developer-friendly platform designed to support the development of **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (**_**DePIN**_**).**&#x20;

Thanks to its efficient Layer 1 **blockchain** and the **verifiable computation** infrastructure powered by Zero Knowledge, IoTeX empowers you to build DePIN projects that are not only fully decentralized but also prioritise scalability, security, and trust.
