# DePIN

[**DePIN**](https://iotex.io/blog/what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks-depin/) stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. It's a new way to build and maintain infrastructure in the physical world. This "infrastructure" can be anything from WiFi hotspots in wireless networks to solar-powered home batteries in energy networks.

DePIN has several benefits over traditional physical infrastructure networks:

1. **Collective ownership:** Through the use of token rewards, contributors are encouraged to deploy and maintain infrastructure. DePIN's bottom-up approach means that the network is collectively owned by its participants, rather than a small group of shareholders.
2. **Distributed Infrastructure Cost:** A decentralized physical infrastructure network reduces overhead and expenses by leveraging the collective resources of a network's participants.
3. **Decentralization:** A decentralized network offers a more resilient and secure infrastructure compared to traditional, centralized infrastructure networks. Building a network in a decentralized manner means that the network is less susceptible to corruption, hijacking and hacks, and other negative externalities associated with centralized control.
4. **Open Competition and Innovation:** DePIN enables new levels of innovation across various sectors. By removing the barriers to entry associated with traditional infrastructure networks, DePIN encourages new entrants to compete in markets that were previously dominated by a few established players.

[**W3bstream**](https://w3bstream.com/) is a fundamental component of any DePIN application. The next section will show some examples on how this technology can be leveraged to create new and innovative real-world based applications.&#x20;
